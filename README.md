# 🎉 AKConverter

**AKConverter** is a Windows desktop application that allows you to easily convert various file and media formats.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: FFmpeg REQUIRED!

Some conversions require **FFmpeg**:  
- WEBP → PNG  
- MP3 → WAV  
- AVI → MP4  

**For easy setup, download the official 3 EXE package:**

[💻 FFmpeg Windows 64-bit (3 EXE) – Official Package](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/download/latest/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip)  

**Steps to use:**
1. Download and extract the zip file.  
2. Place the `ffmpeg.exe`, `ffplay.exe`, and `ffprobe.exe` files in the same folder as Mega File Converter.  
3. Now all conversions that require FFmpeg will work directly! 🚀
